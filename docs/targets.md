# Targets

A repo with more than one language, or one language in more than one place,
declares **targets**: named parts of the repo, each checked from its own root
by the pack that knows its language. A repo without targets is checked as one
TypeScript project at its root, exactly as before. Declaring any switches it
to multi-target mode.

```json
{
  "targets": {
    "web": { "lang": "ts", "root": "web" },
    "scripts": { "lang": "bash", "root": "scripts" }
  }
}
```

[`examples/polyglot-ts-bash`](../examples/polyglot-ts-bash/) runs this config
end to end.

## What a target runs

Each target runs the slots its pack fills, once, from its root: `web:types`,
`web:lint`, `scripts:lint` and so on. The repo-scope slots (`struct`, `docs`,
`links`, `spell`, `prose` and `unclaimed`) still run once, for the whole repo,
under their bare names, and so do top-level custom checks.

A target's slot takes its tool from the target's own `checks`, then from
`packs.<pack>.checks`, then from the top level, then from detection at the
target's root. Once targets are declared, a top-level entry for a target-scope
slot may only switch it off or tune it (`optIn`, `timeout`, `order`), because
the tool depends on the pack. Each check writes under `.check/<target>/` (or
`<out>/<target>/`), and its baseline keys name files from the repo root.

`--only`, `--skip` and `--include` take a slot (every target's), a target (all
of its checks), or `<target>:<slot>` (one check). `--changed` skips each target
nothing changed under.

## The packs

| Pack | Checks | Tools |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ts` | a root and everything under it | the project's package manager, as before |
| `bash` | a list of shell files under its root | shellcheck (`lint`) and shfmt (`format`, opt-in), through `mise` then `PATH` |

A bash target's checks run over its files: by default every `.sh` and `.bash`
file and each extensionless file with a shell shebang, narrowed with `include`
and `exclude` globs. [Packs and pins](./packs.md) covers each pack's tools and
how each tool resolves to the copy that runs.

## Code no target checks

`unclaimed` runs in every multi-target run and fails when a toolchain marker
(`package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `go.mod`, `Cargo.toml`, `pyproject.toml`, a
`.tf` file) sits outside every target of its language, naming the target that
would claim it in `.check/unclaimed.json`. A root `package.json` that only
installs tools, above ts targets in their own directories, goes in
`unclaimed.ignore`, since two ts targets can't nest.

## Declaring targets

- `checkride target add <name> --lang <pack> --root <dir>` adds one, adopting
  the tools its root already configures. In a repo without targets, the
  implicit ts project becomes a target named `app` at `.`, and its top-level
  entries and baseline keys move with it.
- `checkride init` in an existing repo proposes the targets its files suggest,
  and writes them when there's more than the one project at the root.
- `checkride doctor` names the mode, lists the targets, and reports each
  check's pin source and the markers no target claims.

[The contract](./contract.md) holds the exact rules each of these keeps.
